<p> Jon recently graduated from Princeton University with a BA in Economics and minors in Finance and Applications of Computing. In a quest to combine his analytic strengths and critical thinking skills with his more creative and artistic side, Jon joined the Design Track at SINY. </p>

<p> An avid traveler and explorer, Jon has spent previous summers leading health initiatives in a children's health clinic in El Salvador, studying theater in Ireland, and tackling age-old philosophical questions while learning in the Old City of Jerusalem. Jon brings to the table an open mind, a deep curiosity about the world, and the ability to thrive in unfamiliar environments. He is very excited to be a part of the Startup Institute this summer. </p>
